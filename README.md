Welcome to Quizard, an open-source alternative platform for creating and playing interactive quizzes and games.

Our mission is to provide a free and accessible platform for educators, students, and anyone else interested in creating and playing interactive quizzes and games. We believe that learning should be fun and interactive, and that everyone should have the opportunity to access high-quality educational resources.

Our platform is open-source, which means that it is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. This allows for a community of developers and users to collaborate and continuously improve the platform.

Our platform allows users to create and share quizzes and games, with features such as multiple choice questions, true or false questions, and more. It also includes a live game mode for real-time play, and analytics for tracking student progress.

Whether you're an educator looking for a new tool to engage your students, or a student looking for a fun way to study, Quizard has something for you. We invite you to try out our platform and join our community of users and developers. Together, we can make learning fun and interactive for everyone.
