### Finding an Issue

<!-- A concise guide to finding an issue on the repo -->
<!-- Here you can talk about the different labels on the project and what they mean. I think you should also add that if the contributor finds a new issue, they should comment on it and get approval first -->

Here's a complete list of our frontend's [open issues](https://github.com/quizardhq/frontend/issues).

We use labels to indicate the priority, status, and beginner-friendliness of various issues. To find a good issue to work on, look out for some of these labels:

**Issues available for community contribution**

The following tags mark issues that are open for community contribution:

- **good first issue** -> Open to participation from the community and friendly towards new contributors
- **help wanted** -> Open to participation from the community but not necessarily beginner-friendly

**Issues not available for community contribution**

The following tags mark issues that are _not_ open for community contribution:

- **ðŸ”’ core team only** -> To work on this, you need to join the core team.

**Issues not ready to be worked on yet**

The following tags mark issues that are not ready to be worked on yet:

- **ðŸš§ status: blocked** -> Blocked by other work that needs to be done first
- **ðŸ§¹ status: ticket work required** -> Needs additional work before it is ready to be taken up

<!-- Comment on an issue and get it assigned to you -->

### Contribution Process

<!-- How to get started with contributing once you find an issue -->
