## Getting Started

### Finding an Issue

<!-- A concise guide to finding an issue on the repo -->
<!-- Here you can talk about the different labels on the project and what they mean. I think you should also add that if the contributor finds a new issue, they should comment on it and get approval first -->

Here's a complete list of our frontend's [open issues](https://github.com/quizardhq/frontend/issues).

We use labels to indicate the priority, status, and beginner-friendliness of various issues. To find a good issue to work on, look out for some of these labels:

**Issues available for community contribution**

The following tags mark issues that are open for community contribution:

- **good first issue** -> Open to participation from the community and friendly towards new contributors
- **help wanted** -> Open to participation from the community but not necessarily beginner-friendly

Once you've found an issue you would like to work on, check out our [contribution process](###contribution-process) to get started

**Issues not available for community contribution**

The following tags mark issues that are _not_ open for community contribution:

- **ðŸ”’ core team only** -> To work on this, you need to join the core team.

**Issues not ready to be worked on yet**

The following tags mark issues that are not ready to be worked on yet:

- **ðŸš§ status: blocked** -> Blocked by other work that needs to be done first
- **ðŸ§¹ status: ticket work required** -> Needs additional work before it is ready to be taken up

### Contribution Process

<!-- How to get started with contributing once you find an issue -->

<!-- commenting on an issue and get it assigned to you -->
<!-- forking and cloning the repo -->
<!-- creating a separate branch for each feature and making changes as required using a mobile-first approach -->
<!-- sending a pull request -->

### Proposing a New Issue

<!-- Didn't find an issue? How to raise a new one -->

If you discover any bugs while going through the project, or improvements that could be made, **check the list of open issues first** to see if it has been raised already.

If it hasn't, you can file a bug report or suggest a new feature.
