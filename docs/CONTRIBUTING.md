### Finding an Issue

<!-- A concise guide to finding an issue on the repo -->
<!-- Here you can talk about the different labels on the project and what they mean. I think you should also add that if the contributor finds a new issue, they should comment on it and get approval first -->

Here's a list of all our [**open issues**](https://github.com/quizardhq/frontend/issues) for the frontend.

We use labels to indicate the priority, status, and beginner-friendliness of various issues. To find a good issue to work on, look out for some of these labels:

- **Issues available for community contribution:**
  - The following tags mark issues that are open for community contribution:
    - <span style="background-color: rgb(112, 87, 255); color: white; padding: 1px 8px; border-radius: 50px">good-first-issue</span>:
    - <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 134, 114); color: white; padding: 1px 8px; border-radius: 50px">help-wanted</span>:
- **Issues not available for community contribution:**
  - The following tags mark issues that are _not_ open for community contribution:
    - <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 107, 117); color: white; padding: 1px 8px; border-radius: 50px">ðŸ”’ core-team-only</span>:
- **Issues not ready to be worked on yet:**
  - The following tags mark issues that are not ready to be worked on yet:
    - <span style="background-color: rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; padding: 1px 8px; border-radius: 50px">ðŸš§ status-blocked</span>:
