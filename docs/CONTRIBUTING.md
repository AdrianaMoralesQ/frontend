### Finding an Issue

<!-- A concise guide to finding an issue on the repo -->
<!-- Here you can talk about the different labels on the project and what they mean. I think you should also add that if the contributor finds a new issue, they should comment on it and get approval first -->

Here's a list of all our [open issues](https://github.com/quizardhq/frontend/issues) for the frontend.

We use labels to indicate the priority, status, and beginner-friendliness of various issues. To find a good issue to work on, look out for some of these labels:

**Issues available for community contribution:**

The following tags mark issues that are open for community contribution:

- **good-first-issue**
- **help-wanted**

**Issues not available for community contribution:**

The following tags mark issues that are _not_ open for community contribution:

- **ðŸ”’ core-team-only**

**Issues not ready to be worked on yet:**

The following tags mark issues that are not ready to be worked on yet:

- **ðŸš§ status-blocked**
-
